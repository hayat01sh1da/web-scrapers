## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please contact our security team at **security@example.com** or via the security contact form at **https://example.com/security**. Do not file public GitHub issues for security problems.

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **3 business days** and will provide you with a tracking identifier for your report. You can expect progress updates at least every **7 business days** while we investigate and remediate the issue.

After triage, we will assess the severity and impact, develop and test a fix where appropriate, and coordinate a release. If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work with you on coordinated disclosure and, if you wish, discuss public credit in release notes. If we determine that the report does not represent a security vulnerability or is out of scope, we will explain our reasoning and close the report.
